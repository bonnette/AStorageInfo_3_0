<h3><strong>HPE Software-Defined Storage Overview:</strong></h3>
<p><br />
The <strong>HPE StoreOnce VSA</strong> extends   the deployment options for StoreOnce with the agility and flexibility   of a virtual appliance, removing the need to install dedicated data   protection hardware. This provides a flexible and a cost effective   backup target, up to 50 TB, for virtualized server environments as part   of a pure software defined data protection solution or in conjunction   with StoreOnce purpose-built appliances. For simplicity, licenses are   perpetual, all-inclusive and include 3 years HPE support and entitlement   to software updates.</p>
<p>Now you can benefit from StoreOnce capability by installing HPE StoreOnce VSA   into your VMware environment, providing a cost-effective backup target with all   the benefits of StoreOnce. </p>
<p>StoreOnce VSA can deliver a flexible backup target for service providers and   organizations with an ITaaS (IT as a service) infrastructure; rapidly stand-up   the StoreOnce VSA and retire it again when the backup capacity is no longer   needed to regain the resources. In multi-tenant environments, one StoreOnce VSA   per tenant provides security of backup data between tenants.</p>
